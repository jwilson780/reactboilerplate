# Project Title

Basic boilerplate for a React App. I got tired of making this everytime I wanted to create an application so now I just use this repo and go from there. Updated for 2018 and will updated as my needs change.

## Getting Started

Clone Repo into folder.
I use yarn so simply:
<<<<<<< HEAD

- yarn install
- yarn start
  The app should be running on localhost:8080
=======
yarn add
yarn start
